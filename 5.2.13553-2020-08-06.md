### Baselight HOME 베이스라이트&#x20;

*   Since the worldwide pandemic began, there has been greater demand to be able to grade at home. Now when the Baselight system in the facility is not in use, Baselight CONFORM can use that licence to become an enhanced Baselight HOME system, with support for a control surface and the ability to render locally.

    All you need is a VPN to your facility – so the licence can be checked out from the main system – and a Baselight HOME licence, provided on request from baselight-support@filmlight.ltd.uk.

    This applies to Baselight ASSIST as well, which gains the capability to use a connected control surface \[bug 54934]\
    베이스라이트 컨펌을 집과 같은 외부에서 사용시 원격으로 메인 베이스라이트에 연결하여 작업할 수 있으며, 컨트롤판넬과 로컬렌더를 지원합니다. VPN과 홈라이센스가 필요로 합니다.&#x20;
