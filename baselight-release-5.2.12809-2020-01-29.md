# 베이스라이트 릴리즈 노트 5.2.12809 (2020-01-29)

## 최신 기능 (Baselight 5.2.12770 이후)

*   Added support for extracting CDL SOP and SAT values individually in column expressions in Shots View. You can fetch the CDL value for each layer using the syntax:

    ```
    %{CDL#} for Slope, Offset, Power and Saturation

    %{CDL#.SOP} for Slope, Offset and Power together

    %{CDL#.SAT} or %{CDL#.Saturation} for Saturation

    %{CDL#.Slope}, %{CDL#.Offset}, %{CDL#.Power} for Slope, Offset
          and Power individually
    ```

    The # indicates the layer number containing the CDL \[bug 53931]
* Added support for overriding the values exported by the ALE exporter with values from columns in Shots View. If any column is defined in Shots View with an "EDL Name" matching a built-in ALE column, the value will be taken from the Shots View column instead of the default value generated by the ALE exporter \[bug 53931]
* Added support to Media Import Rules for mapping from file metadata into numeric custom columns \[bug 53933]
