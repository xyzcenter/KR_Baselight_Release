# 베이스라이트 릴리즈 노트 5.2.13415 (2020-07-10)

## 중요 안내사항 Important Notes&#x20;

### **5.1 버전과의 호환성 **Compatibility With 5.1** **

새로운 이미지 트랜스폼 설정으로 인해서(자세한 내용은 아래 리스트 참조), 5.2에서 새로운 씬을 저장할 경우 5.1 버전에서는 더 이상을 열리지 않습니다. \
호환성을 위해서 베이스라트, 데이라이트, 플럭스 스토어에는 원격으로 지속적인 이미지 디코딩 작업을 하기위해서 5.2 버전 릴리즈가 설치되어 있어야 합니다. \
버전 5.2에서 BLG파일을 추출한 경우 베이스라이트 에이션을 포함한 5.1버전 제품에서는 사용할 수 없습니다.

Due to changes listed below, notably the new Image Transform Settings, scenes saved in 5.2 will no longer open in 5.1.

So as to ensure consistent image decoding access to remote Baselight, Daylight or FLUX Store systems also require a 5.2 release installed.

BLG files exported from 5.2 cannot be used by 5.1 products, including Baselight Editions.

****

### 베이스라이트 4/8 Baselight FOUR and EIGHT

베이스라이트 5.2 버전이 베이스라이트 4/8 시스템을 지원하는 마지막 버전이 됩니다. 베이스라이트 5.3버전에서는 설치되거나 실행할 수 없습니다.

Baselight 5.2 is the last version that is supported on Baselight FOUR and Baselight EIGHT systems. Baselight 5.3 and later will not install or run on such systems.

### DVI-SDI 컨버터 DVI-to-SDI Convertors

베이스라이트 5.2는 DVI-to-SDI 컨버터나 컴바이너를 사용할 수 있는 마지막 버전입니다. 베이스라이트 5.3 버전 5세대 시스템은 AJA kona4 하드웨어가 포함된 베이스라이트 UHD옵션으로 업그레이드를 하거나 GPU DVI  출력을 사용해야 합니다. 이전세대 시스템의 경우 GPU  DVI만 ㅇ사용할 수 있습니다. \
Baselight 5.2 is also the last version for which DVI-to-SDI Convertors or Combiners performing that function are supported. At Baselight 5.3 Generation V systems will have to either be upgraded to the Baselight Ultra High Definition option (see data sheet) which includes an AJA Kona 4 PCIe card or revert to GPU DVI output. Earlier generation systems will be constrained to a GPU DVI output only.

### 베이스라이트 컨펌 Baselight CONFORM

macOS 10.15 카탈리나에서 베이스라이트 컨펌의 설치 및 실행을 지원합니다. 애플을 향상된 보안설정으로 인해서, 설정 > 보안 > 로컬 디스크 및 원격 디스크의 파일 엑세스 부분에서 베이스라이트를 활성화해야 합니다.&#x20;

Installing and running on macOS 10.15 Catalina is now supported. Due to Apple's enhanced security, you will be asked to permit Baselight to access files on your local and/or remote disks \[bug 51560]

## 최신 기능 (Baselight 5.2.13233 이후)

### 익스포터 Exporters&#x20;

*   Export BLGs, CDLs, LUTs and Stills have been redesigned with an updated UI in an attempt to better standardise the export process.

    "Export Directory" and "Filename" fields have been updated to include more metadata, such as any column available in the Shots View or expressions used within the Render Panel. Custom Column Expressions are also supported.

    The resulting metadata values can be further formatted through the drop-down menu.

    To delete a drop-down, simply backspace over them as if it is normal text. Similiarly, copy/cut/paste operations can be performed like normal text as well.

    Export settings can be saved as presets and loaded from the Scene. To access the Exporters, navigate to the actions cog in the Shots View. Export Stills is now also available there.

    Note that certain export options, such as Stereo, appear contextually based on its relevance \[bug 49095]

### 픽스스팬 Pixspan&#x20;

픽스스팬 압축파일의 읽기와 랜더링을 지원

*   Added support for reading and rendering Pixspan compressed files. The following file types can be read: (읽기)

    * ARRIRAW .ari
    * Cineon
    * DPX
    * OpenEXR
    * PPM
    * SGI
    * TIFF

    The following file types can be rendered: (랜더링)

    * Cineon (10-bit)
    * DPX (10-bit)
    * DPX (12-bit)
    * DPX (16-bit)
    * DPX (16-bit ADX)
    * DPX (Y'CbCr 4:2:2 8-bit)
    * DPX (Y'CbCr 4:2:2 10-bit)
    * DPX (Y'CbCr 4:2:2 16-bit)
    * OpenEXR
    * PPM (8-bit RGB)
    * PPM (16-bit RGB)
    * SGI (8-bit)
    * SGI (16-bit)
    * TIFF (8-bit)
    * TIFF (12-bit for DCI)
    * TIFF (16-bit)

픽스스팬 압축 파일을 랜더할때는 GPU 가속을 사용하기 때문에 추가적인 라이센스가 필요로 합니다. 24기가 VRAM(비디오 메모리)가 있으면 최대 4K 해상도까지 압축/ 압축해제가 됩니다.

라이센스가 필요로 할 경우 문의 바랍니다.\
An additional licence is required to render Pixspan compressed files and to make use of GPU acceleration. Resolutions up to 4K will be compressed/decompressed on the GPU if the GPU has at least 24GB of VRAM.

Please contact baselight-support@filmlight.ltd.uk if you wish to enquire about purchasing this licence \[bug 33871]

## 알려진 이슈들 Known Issues

* When running Baselight CONFORM or Daylight on macOS 10.15 Catalina, local volumes which are defined in volume.cfg within /Volumes can result in "Stale NFS file handle" errors. This is due to a bug in macOS. To work around this issue:
  * open System Preferences from the Dock or the Apple menu
  * choose "Security & Privacy"
  *   click the padlock icon and use your password or Touch ID to allow

      changes to be made
  * select "Full Disk Access" in the list on the left
  * click the "+" button on the right to open a file browser
  * on your keyboard, press "/" to open the "Go to the folder" dialog
  * enter "/sbin" and click "Go"
  *   select the file called "nfsd" and click "Open"

      After restarting your Mac, the volume(s) should now work correctly

      \[bug 53073]
* When running on a Baselight TWO/FOUR/EIGHT system whose UI host has a NVS 450 graphics card, many of the new operators in Baselight 5 currently cause thumbnail errors in Cuts View and elsewhere. This issue will be addressed in a future Baselight 5 release. Please contact FilmLight Support if you wish to discuss upgrading the graphics card in your UI host \[bug 40279]
* Saturated areas in Photo RAW files can acquire a colour tint when adjusting the exposure slider in the Photo RAW Parameters operator while blending highlights \[bug 44769]
* Baselight and Daylight are known to hang on macOS 10.13 High Sierra when run on older (2012 and mid-2014) MacBook Pro machines with nvidia graphics \[bug 44949, bug 48343]
* Sony RAW media added to scenes in Baselight 4.4m1.9217 or earlier may now fail to decode at half resolution. A workaround is to enable Max Quality decoding on the cursor and/or Sequence \[bug 46625]
* Canon RAW media added to scenes in Baselight 5.1.10836 or earlier using the tone curve setting "Canon Log" may now fail to decode with an error message stating "Invalid function parameter". Changing the tone curve will allow images to decode, but will change their look \[bug 50371]
* On first installation on macOS Mojave (10.14) setup of the vol service will fail due to macOS security enhancements. In order to work around this issue it is necessary to manually run the command 'sudo fl-service setup vol' and authorise Terminal to administer the computer \[bug 50732]
* AAC-encoded audio may not sync correctly when reading MP4-files created by Adobe Premiere. Typically the offset is around a frame in either direction \[bug 51199]
* Blackboard Classic Wacom tablet could suffer from disconnections if connected over a local network. If this occurs, turn the Blackboard off, and then on again. This should reconnect the wacom. You will also need to reconnect the Blackboard to Baselight via the dialog.
* Disk Performance Monitoring (DPM) occasionally indicates above threshold latency figures for MSCC 31XX RAID controllers when system performance is not effected \[bug 53435]
