# 베이스라이트 릴리즈 노트 5.0.9853 (2017-10-03)



## New Features Since Baselight 5.0.9842

*   The conversion of 4.4m1 jobs into 5.0 jobs requires the installation of Baselight 4.4m1.9850, available from the FilmLight website.

    This is a 'conversion' release, and should not be used for 4.4m1 jobs, it only needs to be installed for this and later 5.0 releases to convert 4.4m1 jobs fully.

## Bug Fixes Since Baselight 5.0.9842

* Fixed crash using "Set Timecode From Frame Number" in Shots View \[bug 45074]
* Fixed a UTF-8 encoding issue in the conversion process of 4.4m1 jobs into 5.0 jobs \[bug 45067]
