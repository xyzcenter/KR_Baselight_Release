# 베이스라이트 릴리즈 노트 5.2.13191 (2020-05-11)

## 최신 기능 (Baselight 5.2.13115 이후)

*   Added option to import shapes from an SVG file directly into a shape strip (from the shape's 'Customise' menu). Individual SVG bezier paths are treated as (closed) shape curves; additional SVG properties (fill colours, gradients etc) are ignored.

    Once an SVG has been selected, a dialog with several scaling options is presented which control where the SVG will be positioned in the working format's "target area" (see below). These options are:

    "None" : The SVG is translated to the corner of the target area. No Scaling is applied. "Best Fit" : The SVG image is translated to the centre of the target area and pillarboxed or letterboxed to fit the target area's height or width respectively. "Stretch To Fit" : The SVG is stretched horizontally/vertically to fit the target area.

    There are also 2 "Scale/Fit To" options that define the target area (within the working format area) where the SVG will be positioned:

    "Working Format Area" : The target area is the entire working format area. "Viewing Format Area & Mask" : The target area is the current cursor's viewing format mask area transformed into the working format. If no mask is set, the entire viewing format area will be used instead.

    Any scaling applied is based on the SVG's overall image width/height properties.

    Note: SVGs containing complex paths (eg. those generated from freehand sketching) should be avoided, as they could potentially affect playback playback performance. Baselight will generate a warning on import if such an SVG is detected \[bug 51527]
*   Added extra pages of controls to the Tangent Bt Panel.

    Use the bottom-right button to move forward a page, hold-down the bottom-left button (that acts as the Shift key) at the same time to move backwards \[bug 54713]
* Dolby Vision v4 now uses the new v4.1 method of creating fallback v2.9 trim. In addition, wording used in Baselight has been updated to match Dolby standards: "Software CMU" is now "Internal CMU" and "v4.0" is now "v4" \[bug 54295]

## 버그 개선 (Baselight 5.2.13115 이후)

* Fixed crash which occurred when using the  tag in FCP 7 XML files. This non-standard tag is a mechanism added by FilmLight to make it easier to populate a timeline with roto mattes and add a grade layer referencing the matte \[bug 54741]
* Category stripes on Timeline strips now obey the strip brightness preference \[bug 54504]
* Fixed "Failed to transfer frame to SDI device" error that can occur when starting the software \[bug 52559]
* Fixed rare crash when exporting a Gallery Scene \[bug 54280]
* Improved performance of file scanning when some badly-formatted XML files are in the directory \[bug 54759]
* Fixed an issue that prevented some JPEG 2000 JP2-files from being read \[bug 54778]
* Fixed crash when scanning multi-part OpenEXR files where some parts are unnamed \[bug 54725]
* When updating sequence versions and marking updated shots with a category, that category is no longer removed from shots already having it \[bug 54749]
* Fixed the operation of the Sequence refresh button (Update sequence to match media) \[bug 54463]
* Allow 3G-A for 4K Two-wire Interleaved video formats on AJA SDI hardware \[bug 54657]
* Fixed crash in Cuts View when playback filtering is enabled \[bug 54744]
* Fixed Dolby Vision Internal CMU behaviour when the Viewing/Render Colour Space is 100-nit Rec.1886 but there is only Dolby Vision Trim specified for brighter target displays; the CMU output now matches the behaviour encoded in the output XML. This change also applies to the Cursor View "Show v2.9 Behaviour" option \[bug 54843]
* Fixed FilmLight Web Management UI (which runs on port 1984) to allow proxying via an external web server \[bug 54832]
* Improved rendering performance on some Linux systens in some situations \[bug 54863]
