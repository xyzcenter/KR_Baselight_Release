# Baselight Release 4.4.6309 (2013-11-05)



## New Features Since Baselight 4.4.6262

* Added Swap For Blank button to reference strip \[bug 25481]
* Added Do Not Read Cache option to Render View, and restored the -nocacheread option to the bl-render command line \[bug 25422]
* Added support for a length number with % substitutions in Shots View when editing Tape, Clip or Name fields. For example %8W gives the first 8 characters of the input filename template, and %6N the first 5 characters of the tape name \[bug 21263]
* Added Cache All Cursors command (on Cursors menu). This waits until every cursor is fully cached, and can be used to prepare a number of scenes for playback.
* Added Clamp Negative Values option to Image Transform Settings operator (and correspondingly to Scene Settings and Setups). This option can be used to correct artefacts caused when transforming images containing negative pixel values \[bug 25897]
* Sequence Browser now allows viewing the alpha channel of ProRes 4444 movies \[bug 25494]
* The Scene Settings Input Colour Space option now allows selection of "No Conversion" to better support old-style workflows \[bug 25326]
* The Scene Settings Input Colour Space: Automatic/From Metadata (where applicable) option now sets sequences to Input Colour Space: No Conversion when the colour space cannot be determined automatically, and the default colour space of the sequence's Input Format is a historic (Baselight 4.3) colour space \[bug 25838]
* Additional DRT .fltransform files and their cubes should now be located in /usr/fl/etc/colourspaces \[bug 24355]
* Added diagnostic for Slate desks to check if high speed USB 2 connection is available \[bug 25850]
* Added Delete All Keyframes action to Chalk for use on Blackboard 2 desks \[bug 25747]
* Added Fixup Tape command to Shots View, to update the Tape metadata for selected shots \[bug 22966]
* Multi-Paste of Layer 0 now pastes the Orientation (flip/flop) into Sequences \[bug 25892]
* ARRIRAW Parameters is now available on the Insert menu and can be added as an operator to layers.
* Render To Cache (or bl-render -tocache) and Prepare for Review now both perform the same operation as background caching in Baselight: they quickly check the cached files, and cache every explicitly- cached strip plus the bottom of the stack. In order to do this correctly you must now specify whether the cache is for a progressive or interlaced display \[bug 25849]
* Waveforms now have an "Auto" Legal Overlay option, that sets the overlay to full or legal depending on the viewing colour space \[bug 25476]
