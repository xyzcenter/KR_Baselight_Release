# Baselight Release 4.4.6600 (2014-03-06)



## New Features Since Baselight 4.4.6570

* Added the "ACES RRT 0.7" display rendering transform \[bug 26841]
* ARRIRAW files now support crop rectangles, this is useful for ALEXA Open Gate files \[bug 26738]
* The 'transfer characteristic' is read from DPX metadata and used where appropriate to set ADX Log as the 'From Metadata' colour space in the sequence operator \[bug 26816]
* Added the parameter operators for DNG, Indiecam, Sony RAW, CineForm and RAW to the Insert menu, and to the optional operators for all layers \[bug 26900]
* Added support for reading Fuji RAF file format. The decode of these files is currently very slow \[bug 25733]
* ARRIRAW decode now gives a smoother histogram in the shadows instead of a sharp cut-off for the sub-blacks, which is a closer match to the ARRI render. The old decode is preserved for existing scenes \[bug 26641]
* Added the Baselight 4.4 User Guide and Reference Manuals.
