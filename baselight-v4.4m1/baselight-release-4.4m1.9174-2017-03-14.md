# Baselight Release 4.4m1.9174 (2017-03-14)



## New Features Since Baselight 4.4m1.9153

*   To reduce confusion which was caused by the introduction of correct

    QuickTime colour space tagging in Baselight 4.4m1.9029, the Render

    View now offers the choice to use "Legacy" tagging. This tags output

    QuickTime movies as Rec.709, PAL or NTSC based purely on the

    resolution of the image. The new behaviour which tags the movie

    using information from the render colour space is available by

    selecting "Automatic" tagging \[bug 31853]
