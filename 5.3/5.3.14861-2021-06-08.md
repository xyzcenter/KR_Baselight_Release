# 베이스라이트 릴리즈 노트 5.3.14861 (2021-06-08)

## Important Notes

Baselight 5.3 no longer supports the following legacy hardware and OS plaforms:

* Baselight FOUR and Baselight EIGHT systems
* DVI-to-SDI Convertors or Combiners performing that function
* RME Hammerfall audio cards
*   Tape deck control within Baselight (the standalone VTRE application

    remains available)
* Spirit telecine control
* NVIDIA Quadro NVS 450 GPU (as a User Interface display card)
* macOS 10.13 and earlier

Generation V systems using DVI-to-SDI Convertors or Combiners need to either be upgraded to the Baselight Ultra High Definition option (see data sheet) which includes an AJA Kona 4 PCIe card or revert to GPU DVI output. Earlier generation systems are now constrained to a GPU DVI output only.

Please contact Baselight support to discuss upgrading from a NVS 450 if required.

FLOS 8 or later is required to use GPU JPEG 2000 acceleration with Nvidia Ampere GPUs\

## 최신 기능 (Baselight 5.3.14688이후)

###

* Added the ability to override audio track creation when rendering supplemental IMF packages. This includes replacing individual audio tracks in IMF packages using 5.1 + 2.0 channels of audio. It also makes it possible to add separate new 5.1 or 2.0 channel audio tracks to corresponding single track master packages to create supplemental packages with 5.1 + 2.0 channels \[bug 57502]\

* Operations are now automatically deleted from the queue one month after they were submitted, in order to reduce issues caused by very large operations databases. To preserve an operation for future reference please use the Archive functionality \[bug 35329]
* Render operations no longer log inconsistencies in timecode and/or tape name when rendering to movie deliverables \[bug 56826]
* The flos-tools support package for FilmLightOS 6.4 has been updated to 6.4.14855. Changes include:
  * Support for Samsung 6.4TB NVME devices 삼성 6.4TB NVME 디바이스 지원
  * The fl-setup-nvme command now ignores NVME devices that are not standard hardware \[bug 57885]
* The SDI metadata now correctly reflects whether the SDI signal from an AJA IO device contains HLG HDR information \[bug 57819]
* Added support for NVIDIA Quadro A6000 GPU \[bug 56878]\
  엔비디아 쿼드로 A6000 GPU 지원

## Bug Fixes Since Baselight 5.3.14688

* Fixed an issue where the timecode of XAVC Long and XDCAM encoded MXF files could appear incorrect or have stamps out of order \[bug 57371]
* Changed the structure of IMF audio MXF files created with Baselight to improve compatibility with other software \[bug 57512]
* Fixed bug that caused the current cursor in a multiple-cursor display layout to show an X failure if any of the other cursors failed (e.g. due to missing media) \[bug 57647]
* Fixed regression preventing joining of multiple vertical strips \[bug 57589]
* Fix issue where attempting to join strips could cause an internal error \[bug 57839]
* Fixed failure to decode MXF Apple ProRes media which is stored with a larger image area than it presents \[bug 57683]
* Fixed a GPU memory allocation issue that could result in errors including "cudaGraphicsGLRegisterImage failed" \[bug 57884]
* SSH host key files now have their mode corrected at system boot time \[bug 57076]
* Fixed a bug in the install program that would create warnings on the terminal for .propagate.save files \[bug 57376]
* Fixed an error in the bl-kill command on FLOS 8 \[bug 57775]
* Fixed an issue that could have resulted in failure to generate thumbnail images for ProRes RAW material on FilmLightOS 8 \[bug 57937]
* Fixed crash on multi-GPU systems when playing back from cache with multiple cursors visible on SDI output \[bug 36536]
* Prevent crash reports (when enabled) from being sent to FilmLight more than once \[bug 57575]

## Known Issues

* When running Baselight CONFORM or Daylight on macOS 10.15 Catalina, local volumes which are defined in volume.cfg within /Volumes can result in "Stale NFS file handle" errors. This is due to a bug in macOS. To work around this issue:
  * open System Preferences from the Dock or the Apple menu
  * choose "Security & Privacy"
  *   click the padlock icon and use your password or Touch ID to allow

      changes to be made
  * select "Full Disk Access" in the list on the left
  * click the "+" button on the right to open a file browser
  * on your keyboard, press "/" to open the "Go to the folder" dialog
  * enter "/sbin" and click "Go"
  *   select the file called "nfsd" and click "Open"

      After restarting your Mac, the volume(s) should now work correctly

      \[bug 53073]
* Saturated areas in Photo RAW files can acquire a colour tint when adjusting the exposure slider in the Photo RAW Parameters operator while blending highlights \[bug 44769]
* Baselight 5 enables GPU acceleration in OFX plugins. This improves performance but may introduce new issues depending on the 3rd-party plugin implementation \[bug 47224]
* Canon RAW media added to scenes in Baselight 5.1.10836 or earlier using the tone curve setting "Canon Log" may now fail to decode with an error message stating "Invalid function parameter". Changing the tone curve will allow images to decode, but will change their look \[bug 50371]
