# 베이스라이트 릴리즈 노트+ 5.3.14652 (2021-04-15)

## 최신 기능 (Baselight 5.3.14396 이후)&#x20;

### 개선된 Scopes&#x20;

* All scopes can now show results from analysing the actual image shown on the display, including when in Wipe Layout, 2x1 Layout etc. \
  모든 스코프에서 와이프, 2x1 레이아웃등을 할때를 포함하여 실제 보여주는 이미지를 분석한 결과를 스코프에 나타냅니다.
* Scope Views are now grouped together on the Views menu. \
  스코프 뷰는 뷰(View)메뉴에서 그룹핑되어 나타납니다.
* Scope Views now have a consistent right-click menu to control their options. \
  스코프뷰는 옵션을 제어하는 일정한 오른쪽 클릭메뉴를 갖습니다.
* Improved the apperance of text labels in Scope Views. \
  스코프뷰에서 텍스트 라벨의 모양이 개선되었습니다.
* The Y'CbCr matrix used by scopes is now set from the SDI output setting where appropriate. \
  스코프에서 사용되는 Y'CbCr 매트릭스가 적절한 SDI 출력설정으로 설정됩니다.
* Vectorscope/Chromaticity scopes now have options to show a chromaticity plot using CIE xy, CIE u'v' or FilmLight rg axes, with optional overlays of the gamuts of the Input, Working, Mastering and Viewing Colour Spaces. \
  백터스코프/크로마시키 스코프는 이제 CIE xy, CIE u'v', FilmLight rg 축을 사용하여 입력/워킹/마스터링/뷰잉 컬러스페이스의 색공간의 오버레이를 표시합니다.
* Chromaticity scopes can be panned and zoomed, with buttons to reset the pan/zoom and to set it to fit the Viewing Colour Space gamut \[bug 49079]\
  크로마시티 스코프는 팬/줌을 할 수 있으며, 팬/줌 재설정 버튼과 뷰잉 색공간맞춤 버튼을 설정할 수 있습니다.

### 기타기능 &#x20;

* Added support for reading HEIF/HEIC image files \[bug 43580]\
  HEIF/HEIC 이미지 파일 읽기 지원 추가
* Added support for reading Cintel RAW image files, with a new Cintel Params operator to control the decode. Because the Blackmagic Cintel SDK is slow to decode these files, input strip caching is enabled by default for this media \[bug 48169]\
  디코딩을 조절할 수 있는 Cintel 파라미터 오퍼레이터를 가진 Cinetal RAW 이미지 파일 읽기 지원 추가. 블랙매직 Cinetel SDK이 이 파일을 디코딩할때 느리기 때문에 입력 스트립 캐싱이 본 미디어에는 기본적으로 활성화되어 있습니다.
* fl-service has a new implementation for CentOS 8/FilmLightOS 8 systems, which generates a native systemd unit for each FilmLight fl-service. The command-line options are unchanged \[bug 52226]
* Added feature to show the cursor number icons at the scene dropdown menu \[bug 56002]
* When loading ALE files, columns labelled "LUT1" and "LUT 1" are now mapped to the standard "LUT" column. Similarly, columns labelled "LUT 2" are now mapped to the standard "LUT2" column \[bug 56931]
* Blackmagic RAW media is now decoded using Metal on macOS \[bug 57008]\
  블랙매직 RAW 미디어는 macOS 상에서는 Metal을 사용하여 디코딩할 수 있습니다.
* Updated to Dolby Vision SIDK version 4.2.0. This includes some minor bug fixes \[bug 56862]\
  돌비 비젼 SIDK 4.2.0 버전이 업데이트 되었습니다. 여기에는 몇가지 마이너 버그개선이 포함되었습니다.
* Added burnin/Text options for Input Format pixel aspect ratio %{InputPAR} and Sequence frame rate %{InputFrameRate} \[bug 52724]\
  입력포맷픽셀 화면비 %{InputPAR}와 시퀀스 프레임레이트 %{InputFrameRate}로 번인/텍스트 옵션 추가
* The two timecodes reported by RED media have been swapped, because the old Timecode 2 is almost always the desired value. RED "Absolute/Time-of-day timecode" is now Timecode, and RED "Edge timecode" is now Timecode 2. When inserting RED media you should no longer select Timecode 2 in FLUX Manage or in a Media Import Rule \[bug 32161]
* Avid DNxHD codecs have been renamed to match Avid's recent changes \[bug 57271]
* Added support for reading BRAW media from the Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K camera \[bug 57314]\
  블랙매직 URSA 미니 프로 12K 카메라의 BRAW 미디어 읽기 지원 추가
* "Export Mark and Shot Data..." is a new export option that has been added to Shots View. It is accessible via the 'Action Menu'. It allows exporting of shot data such as Marks, Client Notes, File and Clip names and location to a text file. Fields to be exported can be selected in the the export dialog \[bug 56717]
*   New Scene Detect View (note: accessible via the Sequence Operator, in the same way as the old Scene Detect).

    Scene Detect has a new, improved algorithm, plus options to detect cuts to/from black and to set the minimum length of a cut (useful to prevent strobe flashes causing invalid cuts) \[bug 56623]
* Scene Detect now gives the option to retry at cursor resolution if the original resolution is unavailable \[bug 57017]
*   It is now possible to join multiple selected strips using Ctrl-K or Cmd-K, provided the source material for the resultant joined strip can be represented as a single contiguous sequence. This would typically be in a situation where you start with a single piece of media and add cuts using an EDL or Scene Detector.

    Note that you must make sure the cursor is positioned on one of the cuts you wish to join, as otherwise a new cut will be added instead \[bug 25488]
*   Added "Emit Composites as Dissolves" option to CMX3600 EDL Export panel. Enabling this will resulting in Blend composites at the bottom a stack to be treated as Dissolves, meaning that metadata for both sides of the Blend will be included in the EDL. In addition, a comment will be added to the event giving blend value. This value may be constant:

    * BLEND: 0.4992

    ..or animated, where all the keyframes are emitted:

    * BLEND: 0:0 9:0.4992 70:0.1175 137:0.8448

    in the form \<frame number relative event start >:\<blend value> \[bug 56911]
*   IMF package export now supports 5.1 + 2.0 channel audio. Setting the audio channels in Render View to '8 channels (5.1 + 2.0)' will produce separate 5.1 and 2.0 audio tracks in the same package. Source channels 1-6 are used for 5.1 surround and source channels 7-8 for the 2.0 channel stereo track. When reading an IMF package with 5.1 and 2.0 tracks, both tracks will be loaded into channels 1-6 and 7-8 respectively. When exporting Netflix IMF packages the only available choices for audio export are 5.1 or 5.1 + 2.0.

    Support for writing Output Profile Lists (OPLs) has been dropped as part of this change \[bug 57100]
* Audio language is now a separate setting when rendering IMF packages and IMF audio MXF files. It was previously available as a codec parameter. Custom language codes can be entered in addition to the predefined set. Language metadata read from MXF files and IMF packages will now expand the language code into the name of the language where possible \[bug 57141]

## Known Issues

* When running Baselight CONFORM or Daylight on macOS 10.15 Catalina, local volumes which are defined in volume.cfg within /Volumes can result in "Stale NFS file handle" errors. This is due to a bug in macOS. To work around this issue:
  * open System Preferences from the Dock or the Apple menu
  * choose "Security & Privacy"
  *   click the padlock icon and use your password or Touch ID to allow

      changes to be made
  * select "Full Disk Access" in the list on the left
  * click the "+" button on the right to open a file browser
  * on your keyboard, press "/" to open the "Go to the folder" dialog
  * enter "/sbin" and click "Go"
  *   select the file called "nfsd" and click "Open"

      After restarting your Mac, the volume(s) should now work correctly

      \[bug 53073]
* Saturated areas in Photo RAW files can acquire a colour tint when adjusting the exposure slider in the Photo RAW Parameters operator while blending highlights \[bug 44769]
* Baselight 5 enables GPU acceleration in OFX plugins. This improves performance but may introduce new issues depending on the 3rd-party plugin implementation \[bug 47224]
* Canon RAW media added to scenes in Baselight 5.1.10836 or earlier using the tone curve setting "Canon Log" may now fail to decode with an error message stating "Invalid function parameter". Changing the tone curve will allow images to decode, but will change their look \[bug 50371]
