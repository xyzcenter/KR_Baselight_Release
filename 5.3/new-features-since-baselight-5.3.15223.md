# New Features Since Baselight 5.3.15223



Baselight Release 5.3.15583 (2021-10-25)

## New Features Since Baselight 5.3.15223

* Added Shadow Detail Shader Source to generate a test pattern for evaluating shadow detail rendition for a given viewing condition. This is useful in a remote grading session to evaluate a remote display's ability to display shadow details \[bug 55186]
* Added BMD Film Gen5 colour space to FilmLight website \[bug 58105]
* bl-backupdb now runs tasks in parallel for improved performance. Use the -T command-line option or TASKS configuration file option to set the number of parallel tasks (the default is 2). More information can be found in the help text, running "bl-backupdb -i" will show it \[bug 46992]
* Blackboard Classic setup now allows the adjustment of the Active and Selected LED brightness levels. This is separate from the Master LED brightness, and will set the brightness levels of Active buttons and Selected buttons. Note: After any adjustment please wait a few seconds to see the effect of the change \[bug 57719]
* Added additional substitutions to Render View, Exporters & Burnins. %{Year}, %{Month}, %{Day}, %{Hour} and %{Minute} \[bug 29805]
* Added support for AJA T-TAP Pro \[bug 56517]
* TIFF and JPEG files with "Display P3" colour profile metadata are now assigned the appropriate colour space \[bug 58348]
* Added 'Mark only' toggle to scene detect for situations where you only want to mark the cut points without making actual edits to the timeline \[bug 58328]
* Added support for decoding AVC-Intra 4:2:2 (ai42) in QuickTime and MP4 files \[bug 58289]
* Added 'English (United States)' to the predefined set of language codes available when rendering IMF packages and IMF audio files \[bug 58194]
* Burnin editing in the Formats editor is now more interactive, with changes now reflected on-screen while the sliders are being dragged \[bug 58380]
* Supplemental IMF packages which trim the start of the master package can now be created by leaving a gap at the start of the current scene. This avoids having to replace all audio to match media that was moved on the timeline \[bug 58267]
* Added a substitution to Burnins, Shots View and Render View to return Scene name without the name of the folder %{SceneNameOnly} \[bug 58406]
* Added an option to write an OutputProfileList (OPL) when creating an IMF package \[bug 58195]
* Updated to libsamplerate version 0.2.1. This fixes an issue where audio renders could fail with a message about failing to generate any samples \[bug 58391]
* Updated to DNxHD/DNxHR/DNxUncompressed SDK version 2.7.1. This fixes a crash with DNxUncompressed \[bug 58556]
* Added support for writing Avid DNxUncompressed MXF files. The following DNxUncompressed codecs are now available:
  * DNxUncompressed 4:2:2 8-bit
  * DNxUncompressed 4:2:2 10-bit
  * DNxUncompressed 4:2:2 12-bit
  * DNxUncompressed 4:2:2 16(2.14)-bit
  * DNxUncompressed 4:2:2 floating-point
  * DNxUncompressed RGB 8-bit
  * DNxUncompressed RGB 10-bit
  * DNxUncompressed RGB 12-bit
  * DNxUncompressed RGB 16(2.14)-bit
  * DNxUncompressed RGB floating-point \[bug 53180]
* Several settings on the Display menu now remember their state the next time the application is run: "Deflicker Blur", "Home Zoom is 1:1 Pixels", "Bilinear Filtering", "Zoom/Pan Ganging" and "Show Playback fps". Three corresponding preferences have been removed \[bug 58512]
* Added support for reading OpenEXR files containing 4:2:0 luminance-chroma data, such as those written by ProEXR \[bug 58642]
* Updated to RED SDK 8.0.4. This fixes out of memory errors not reported for Komodo clips \[bug 58256]
*   The Blackboard Classic can now be used to control a remote Baselight. This requires a connection to the remote machine, a local machine with the Blackboard Classic connected and the same version of Baselight installed on both systems.

    On the remote machine, in "Preferences -> System -> External Devices", the "Blackboard Classic" should be set to "Ethernet - Blackboard Classic". The IP address of the local machine must be added to the Blackboard Classic Device configuration.

    Once set up, Baselight can be started on the remote machine, it will then connect and use the local Blackboard Classic \[bug 57397]
* Improved layout of the Reference operator when using layers with long names \[bug 58563]
* Added line breaks to the base64 encoded CipherValue fields in KDMs. This improves compliance with SMPTE 430-3 \[bug 58652]
* Fixed (shot) mark toggle when a shot's frame rate doesn't match the scene's working frame rate \[bug 55435]
* Updated to TIFF library version 4.3.0. This should improve stability when working with TIFF media \[bug 58708]
* Improved the speed of conform when 'Match by Avid UID' is chosen from the conform parameters \[bug 46582]

## Bug Fixes Since Baselight 5.3.15223

* Fixed behaviour of temporal operators (Denoise, Temporal Degrain, Deflicker etc) in interlaced scenes \[bug 57190]
* The '-s' option has been removed from fl-setupssh, as it is not required. On a Baselight TWO/X, the command can be run from either the main processing node or a netbooted UI host, as it only changes config files in the user's .ssh directory \[bug 58287]
* Fixed move row cursor up or down complete stack when ctrl + shift + arrow key is pressed on the Blackboards or Slate \[bug 58330]

* Fixed crash when using Media Import Rules View with no scene open \[bug 58619]
* Media Import Rules View no longer shows reset-to-metadata buttons for decode params \[bug 58646]
* Fixed "Duration" column being 00:00:00:00 in ALE export in some cases when the hour of the end timecode was 23 \[bug 57821]
* Fixed very occasional hang when processing the render queue. This hang would cause the processing of an operation to not proceed until Baselight/Daylight was restarted \[bug 58614]
