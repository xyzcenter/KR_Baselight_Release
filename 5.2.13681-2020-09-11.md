# 베이스라이트 릴리즈 노트 5.2.13681 (2020-09-11)

## Important Notes

Baselight 5.2 no longer supports macOS Sierra (10.12).

### Compatibility With 5.1

Due to changes listed below, notably the new Image Transform Settings, scenes saved in 5.2 will no longer open in 5.1.

So as to ensure consistent image decoding access to remote Baselight, Daylight or FLUX Store systems also require a 5.2 release installed.

BLG files exported from 5.2 cannot be used by 5.1 products, including Baselight Editions.

### Baselight FOUR and EIGHT

Baselight 5.2 is the last version that is supported on Baselight FOUR and Baselight EIGHT systems. Baselight 5.3 and later will not install or run on such systems.

### DVI-to-SDI Convertors

Baselight 5.2 is also the last version for which DVI-to-SDI Convertors or Combiners performing that function are supported. At Baselight 5.3 Generation V systems will have to either be upgraded to the Baselight Ultra High Definition option (see data sheet) which includes an AJA Kona 4 PCIe card or revert to GPU DVI output. Earlier generation systems will be constrained to a GPU DVI output only.

### Baselight CONFORM

Installing and running on macOS 10.15 Catalina is now supported. Due to Apple's enhanced security, you will be asked to permit Baselight to access files on your local and/or remote disks \[bug 51560]

## 최신 기능 (Baselight 5.2.13543이후)

### 베이스라이트 홈 Baselight HOME

*   Since the worldwide pandemic began, there has been greater demand to be able to grade at home. Now when the Baselight system in the facility is not in use, Baselight CONFORM can use that licence to become an enhanced Baselight HOME system, with support for a control surface and the ability to render locally.

    All you need is a VPN to your facility – so the licence can be checked out from the main system – and a Baselight HOME licence, provided on request from baselight-support@filmlight.ltd.uk.

    This applies to Baselight ASSIST as well, which gains the capability to use a connected control surface \[bug 54934]

### 기타 기능 Miscellaneous

* Updated to RED SDK 7.3.4. This contains fixes as follows:
  * R3D trim could produce corrupt output
  * Added support for Komodo camera
  * Fixed corruption in low-resolution CPU decodes
  * Fixed rare potential crash with Komodo clips
  * Fixed small memory leaks for each opened clip
  *   Fixed potential performance drop in CPU decompression

      Please note this SDK can produce very slightly different images from

      the previous version \[bug 55714]
* Updated to Codex HDE SDK 3.4.2 (used for reading .arx files). This contains fixes as follows:

## 알려진 이슈들

* When running Baselight CONFORM or Daylight on macOS 10.15 Catalina, local volumes which are defined in volume.cfg within /Volumes can result in "Stale NFS file handle" errors. This is due to a bug in macOS. To work around this issue:
  * open System Preferences from the Dock or the Apple menu
  * choose "Security & Privacy"
  *   click the padlock icon and use your password or Touch ID to allow

      changes to be made
  * select "Full Disk Access" in the list on the left
  * click the "+" button on the right to open a file browser
  * on your keyboard, press "/" to open the "Go to the folder" dialog
  * enter "/sbin" and click "Go"
  *   select the file called "nfsd" and click "Open"

      After restarting your Mac, the volume(s) should now work correctly

      \[bug 53073]
* When running on a Baselight TWO/FOUR/EIGHT system whose UI host has a NVS 450 graphics card, many of the new operators in Baselight 5 currently cause thumbnail errors in Cuts View and elsewhere. This issue will be addressed in a future Baselight 5 release. Please contact FilmLight Support if you wish to discuss upgrading the graphics card in your UI host \[bug 40279]
* Saturated areas in Photo RAW files can acquire a colour tint when adjusting the exposure slider in the Photo RAW Parameters operator while blending highlights \[bug 44769]
* Baselight and Daylight are known to hang on macOS 10.13 High Sierra when run on older (2012 and mid-2014) MacBook Pro machines with nvidia graphics \[bug 44949, bug 48343]
* Sony RAW media added to scenes in Baselight 4.4m1.9217 or earlier may now fail to decode at half resolution. A workaround is to enable Max Quality decoding on the cursor and/or Sequence \[bug 46625]
* Canon RAW media added to scenes in Baselight 5.1.10836 or earlier using the tone curve setting "Canon Log" may now fail to decode with an error message stating "Invalid function parameter". Changing the tone curve will allow images to decode, but will change their look \[bug 50371]
* On first installation on macOS Mojave (10.14) setup of the vol service will fail due to macOS security enhancements. In order to work around this issue it is necessary to manually run the command 'sudo fl-service setup vol' and authorise Terminal to administer the computer \[bug 50732]
* AAC-encoded audio may not sync correctly when reading MP4-files created by Adobe Premiere. Typically the offset is around a frame in either direction \[bug 51199]
* Blackboard Classic Wacom tablet could suffer from disconnections if connected over a local network. If this occurs, turn the Blackboard off, and then on again. This should reconnect the wacom. You will also need to reconnect the Blackboard to Baselight via the dialog.
* Disk Performance Monitoring (DPM) occasionally indicates above threshold latency figures for MSCC 31XX RAID controllers when system performance is not effected \[bug 53435]
